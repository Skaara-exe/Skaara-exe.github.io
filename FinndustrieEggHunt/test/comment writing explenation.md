for everyone who already wrote a text i'm sorry, BUT a little bit has changed so far
-- you can use <br> to start a new line
-- you can now use colors inside inside the text by incasing the part you want to color in a color tag <color=#FF0000>Love you all</color>
-- emoji's are now suported (finn's emoji's) by typing FinnLove,...

you still have a bunch of time if you want to make changes, let me know
and for those who want a current preview of the page so far [Test](https://skaara-exe.github.io/FinndustrieEggHunt/test/Test.html)
