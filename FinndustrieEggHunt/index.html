            Hello finn and anyone else whom may stuble across this page. Since you gave me permission to hide an easteregg in the game, I thought about making a little something as a thank you from the community. Also thanks everyone who added a message and SH4DOW4RE for helping a bunch with the website.

                <p>I know I come into the community one day then made some things, modded some stuff and hacked your games but hey we had some good laughs here and there, we came together as a community inspiring each other to strive for things may it be to learn 3D modeling, coding or just general stuff and in my eyes that's pretty good.</p>
