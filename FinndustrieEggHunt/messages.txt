I know I break the game and mod the hell out of it and cheat but hey it was all in good fun - Lecloutpanda
Thank you and Well Done, Mr Dusty - DoctorLeaf
Thank you so much Finn for growing such an amazing community, I’ve never felt so involved in anything like this before and I’m so so grateful to be welcomed and be a part of it. The stuff you create is far from just amazing and I’m so happy to see the stuff you’re creating is getting the recognition it deserves. Never stop doin’ what you’re doin’ - Twig
This game is really fun to play with friends, but the developers got a weird greasy moustache -BlipDip
